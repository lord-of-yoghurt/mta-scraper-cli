MTA Scraper CLI Application

Easily gather data about MTA Subway service status and changes.

* Upon launch, the app will scrape and output the service status of each MTA subway line
from the most recent update.

* In all likelihood, there will be service changes on one or more of the lines. If so, 
the app will ask whether you want to see the exact details and gather them for you.
